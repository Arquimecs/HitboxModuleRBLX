The Ultimate Hitbox Module, I plan on using this for every project I do. I will keep on refining it every time more and more, so we can end up with a truly perfect open-sourced hitbox module.

You can pay 20$ for priority updates, but be advised that the best version of this is saved for actual paid projects and some won't even be released to the public.
